/**
 * Button mixins.
 *
 * For WordPress to work with buttons more efficiently, we seperate colours from
 * the rest of the button styles. This reduces the amount of duplicate CSS when
 * compiled.
 *
 * Buttons have the class .td-button.
 * Additional classes can be a combination of:
 *   .is-style-full
 *   .is-style-outline
 *   .has-[colour-name]-button-color
